summary: A selection of photos to accompany my application for the Bikepacking.com Rider's Lens Grant

click | klɪk |
noun
1. _Slang_ a kilometer: he'd only ridden 40 clicks that morning
2. a short, sharp sound: delayed by the repeated click of a camera shutter

focus | ˈfəʊkəs |
noun 
1. the state or quality of having or producing clear visual definition: hoping the photographs were in focus
2. an act of concentrating interest or activity on something: with the focus now being on reaching home before dark

The bicycle is the perfect vehicle on which to travel at a speed fast enough to cover a fair distance yet slow enough to fully take in the environment through which you are moving. The photograph is the perfect medium to record adventures undertaken by bike and _any_ ride, tiny or epic can provide myriad opportunities to document a sense of place.

Striking a balance between 'clicks' and 'clicks' and 'focus' and 'focus' can be a challenge …

focus | ˈfəʊkəs |
verb
1. (focus on) [with object] concentrate: So what should I focus on?

I'm hoping to be successful in my application and be able to take advantage of the storytelling mentorship workshop so as to develop a cohesive voice for projects within my portfolio.

Below are a fairly random selection of photographs from a variety of cycling adventures I've experienced, both local and further afield.

As a kid my bike was my ticket to adventure and to this day have vivid memories of discovering the world as I knew it on two wheels. 40+ years on and I'm really no different: my bikes are what take me to and through destinations that I want to document and to share with others. I believe photography is by far the best medium with which to do this, whether that be via broad vistas, or select vignettes of places, people, or objects.

I hope to take advantage of the Rider's Lens Grant to give focus and direction to my photography during future adventures. I believe that a critique of existing work, together with mentorship on how best to tell a story via photographs will result in cohesive collections that I'd be proud to share, confident that I'm successfully communicating to others the sense of place that I experience. I believe I have a good eye. The grant would allow me to prove this.
