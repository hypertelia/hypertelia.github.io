summary: A selection of photos to accompany my application for the Bikepacking.com Rider's Lens Grant
---

The bicycle is the perfect vehicle on which to travel at a speed fast enough to cover a fair distance yet slow enough to fully take in the environment through which you are moving. The photograph is the perfect medium to record adventures undertaken by bike and _any_ ride, tiny or epic, can provide myriad opportunities to document a sense of place.

I'm hoping to be successful in my application and be able to take advantage of the storytelling mentorship workshop so as to work on developing a cohesive voice for projects within my portfolio.

Below are a varied and fairly ad hoc selection of photographs from a variety of cycling adventures I've experienced in recent years, both local and further afield.
