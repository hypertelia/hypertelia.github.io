summary: Kentmere to Coniston cycling routes as generated by various routing apps
---

I'm a bit of a map geek and love to spend time reading them and plotting routes. I don't think there's a substitute for manually plotting a route, but it's often quicker to use one of the many route planning apps that are available. I find it interesting how different services will offer up differing routes with the same start and end point, making at times rather questionable choices. 

Without judgement and just for comparison, below are a collection of routes offered up by various services for a short 'Kentmere to Coniston' ride. 

_Note that some of these offer preferences as to the type of bike being ridden and I've left this as whatever the default is._
