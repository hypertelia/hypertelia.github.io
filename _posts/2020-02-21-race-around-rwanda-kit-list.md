With Race around Rwanda being my first ultra-distance event, I'm sure I was no different to many first-timers in scouring the web for information on what more experienced racers carry with them for such races. So, with the wisdom that comes from my solitary finish, it's time to reciprocate …

## Luggage ##
In keeping with trying to do things on the cheap, I used a set of Planet X bike packing bags: A seat pack, frame bag, and top tube bag, paying less than £35 for the lot when they were on sale (I think they're always on sale). 
- In the **seat pack** I kept anything I didn't think I'd need while riding, unless things took a proper turn for the worse.  
- The **frame bag** was used for waterproof jacket and gilet, arm warmers, pump, multi tool, powerbank—the items I was more likely to need between checkpoints or stops.
- The **toptube bag** was used for food and phone.

I fitted two side access Zefal bottle cages, with the seat tube mount shifted down using a King cage Universal Support Bolt. This set up meant I could squeeze in a 600 and a 700ml bottle beneath the frame bag.

## Electrics ##
- **GPS**: A Wahoo Elemnt chosen as an upgrade on a Garmin Edge 520 based on LBS advice to offer turn-by-turn navigation features, a nice big screen, and great battery life. The navigation was usually spot-on although did seem to lag a little in some more built up areas. 
    - HRM (Wahoo Tickr, which only connected to GPS on one of four days for some reason)
    - Cadence sensor
    - Speed/Distance sensor
- **Lights**: Busch & Muller Lumotec Premium Cyo IQ 80 N+ front and Busch & Muller Secula rear, wired to a Jtek dynamo hub. I used these for commuting on unlit country lanes for years and knew they'd suffice. I stuck an additional Nite Rider Cherry Bomb rear on top of the seat pack, and carried a Petzl e+LITE as an emergency back-up. 
- **Powerbank**: Anker PowerCore 2010. I had to use this once to charge my phone, but managed to find mains power to top up the GPS and phone the rest of the time.
- **Phone**: iPhone 7+ to use primarily as camera but also back up GPS, with maps downloaded for offline use.
- **Back-up phone**: Basic 'non-smart' Nokia phone with local sim for making emergency calls. 
- **USB charger** Anker 17W 2-Port PowerPort 2 Lite with euro plug. Perhaps a bit chunky but quick to charge things up.
- **Cables**: Lightning and micro USB cables for charging.

## Tools ##
- **Multitool**: A [Unior Multitool EURO13](https://uniortools.com/eng/product/1655EURO13-multitool-euro13) Good quality with tools to cover all components. The chain tool is a little rattly when folded though, so needed to wrap an elastic band round it.
- **Leatherman**: An [original PST model](https://www.leatherman.com/pst-77.html). Would have taken a smaller version, but misplaced it. Fills the gaps in the multitool's features (Pliers, cutters, and knife blade).
- **Pump**: A [Lezyne Micro Floor Drive HP](https://ride.lezyne.com/collections/hand-pumps/products/1-mp-mfdr-v204hp?variant=19837367779414). Having the pressure gauge gave the local kids who 'helped' fix any flat something to look at and monitor.
- **Cassette breaker/Spoke Key**: If I needed to replace a drive side rear spoke then I'd need to have removed the cassette. The [Unior 2 in 1 pocket spoke and cassette lockring tool](https://uniortools.com/eng/product/1669-4-2-in-1-pocket-spoke-and-cassette-lockring-tool#44729) takes up no space and doubles as spoke wrench.
