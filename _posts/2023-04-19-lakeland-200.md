summary: A write up of an ITT of the Lakeland 200 
---

There's only 6 weeks to go before the <a href="https://highlandtrail550.weebly.com">HT550</a> which is my big event this year—perhaps my big event of any year—and while I've been putting in plenty of endurance-paced training rides haven't really tested myself by riding a route of similar style to what I understand that to be. I thought about riding the Dales Divide group start again this year, but decided instead to tackle the Lakeland 200. The end result wasn't pretty but with hindsight I can only see my experience doing it as a positive thing and one that will hopefully stand my in good stead for bigger things.

I'd been a little casual in my planning to ride the Lakeland 200, with a vague thought of doing it just some weekend sometime around Easter, perhaps with a <a href="https://www.kendal.cc">Kendal CC</a> club mate who'd expressed an interest in doing it too. He turned out to be off skiing for the month, so my ride became a self-supported ITT attempt. No bad thing, as HT550's the same. I knew that a 40 hours completion time was deemed a 'finish' and also that the FKT was a ridiculous sub 17 hours, so felt somewhere around 30 hours would be required to complete, so setting off of a Sunday morning would have me finish Monday lunchtime. I then saw the wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYphY7XfEIo">Steezy Collective Lakeland 200 Project movie</a> and had a bit of a rethink: They looked to be really gunning for it, and are far more experienced in predomindantly off-road endurance events and came in around that 30 hour mark too. Perhaps 36 hours was a more reasonable aim. With that I decided to set off at sunrise on the Sunday. (Lesson learned number 1)

I've been gradually getting a bike and kit ready for HT550.
