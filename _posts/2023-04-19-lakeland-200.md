summary: A write up of an ITT of the Lakeland 200 
---

There's only 6 weeks to go before the <a href="https://highlandtrail550.weebly.com">HT550</a> which is my big event this year—perhaps my big event of any year—and while I've been putting in plenty of endurance-paced training rides haven't really tested myself by riding a route of similar style to what I understand that to be. I thought about riding the Dales Divide group start again this year, but decided instead to tackle the Lakeland 200. The end result wasn't pretty but with hindsight, I can only see my experience doing it as a positive thing.

I'd been a little casual in my planning to ride the Lakeland 200, with a vague thought of doing it a weekend sometime around Easter, perhaps with a Kendal CC club mate who'd expressed an interest in doing it too. He turned out to be off skiing for the month, so my ride became a self-supported ITT attempt. No bad thing, as HT550's the same.

I've been gradually getting a bike and kit ready for HT550.
