**You're [not] doing it wrong**

This week (in August 2021) [Bianchi anncounced new gravel bikes](https://road.cc/content/tech-news/bianchi-reveals-new-impulso-pro-gravel-bike-285501) and noticeable in reaction was people complaining about a perceived lack of tyre clearance, stating the 38mm maximum to have no place on a gravel bike in 2021. I say nonsense: You pays your money and you takes your choice. I've currently got wheels and/or bikes set up with 25mm, 28mm, 32mm, 38mm, 47mm, 2.25", and 4.8" and will happily ride at least the 32mm thru 2.25" on the same trails. 

Prior to 'gravel' becoming a thing we rode cyclocross bikes outside of race parcours on the fells and trails. Prior to the luxury of an n+1 'cross bike we rode whatever we had, wherever we chose to ride it. Just as the [Rough Stuff Fellowship](https://www.rsf.org.uk) and countless individuals have been doing for years: Ya run what ya brung. 

Just as photographers talk of the best camera being the one you have with you, the best bike is the one you have with you, and bikes are invariably capable of doing far more than the niche they are marketed at. There's too much talk of what is right or wrong _now_, when the roads and trails we ride haven't changed much for eons. Back in the 80s we rode our mountain bikes with the seat up high, 130+mm stems, and super narrow handlebars and had a blast doing so. Is it more fun now saddle and bars are level and we have 800mm wide bars pretty much coming straight from the steerer tube? I was smiling when riding then, and I'm still smiling now. It's all good ~~clean~~ muddy fun and on the same trails. I'll happily concede that changes in component and specs allow for more technical, bigger, gnarlier, whatever terrain to be ridden, but this takes nothing away from the pleasure on offer without those advances.

Back to that Bianchi: Thousands of cyclists race cyclocross each winter with rules preventing them going wider than 33mm. Hundreds complete the 3 Peaks race under the same restriction. You can ride 'big' on 33s. I raced around Rwanda on all manner of surfaces on 33s. Hell, there was a kid who rode on 25s. And rim brakes! 3 Peaks CX is jokingly explained as 'unsuitable bikes on unsuitable terrain' but really just helps to showcase what 'skinny' tyres can handle. If you're dropping Â£3400 on a bike chances are you know exactly what you're doing and may well have considered that 38mm max.
