**You're [not] doing it wrong**

This week (in August 2021) [Bianchi anncounced new gravel bikes](https://road.cc/content/tech-news/bianchi-reveals-new-impulso-pro-gravel-bike-285501) and most noticeable in reaction was people complaining about the lack of tyre clearance, stating the 38mm maximum to have no place on a gravel bike in 2021.
