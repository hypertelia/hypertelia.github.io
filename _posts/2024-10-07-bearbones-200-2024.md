summary: A write up of the 2024 Bear Bones 200 ride
---

The Bear Bones 200 is not a race. It's more a challenge where the top prize is a Black Badge, awarded for completing the route in less than 24 hours. Sure you can smash it beginning to end and be first back but any kudos earned is the same as taking 23 hours and 59 minutes. This is relevant as this year's BB200 was perhaps the most personal challenge I've ever set myself … 

I received the invite to enter the BB200 while lying in a hospital bed, head in a brace, strapped to the bed, amd only able to stare up at the ceiling tiles. The day prior I'd had an over-the-bars moment and broken 6 vertebrae and a rib for good measure. I've long since said that I perpetually need an event in the calendar to train for, so it made sense to get something in to recover for. I duly signed up while I was waiting on an MRI scan to better access whether there was any spinal cord damage or whether I needed surgery. Given how bad things could have been I kinda lucked out: I was out of hospital after 5 days with no surgery required. I was to wear a neck brace for the next few weeks and give it 6-8 weeks for the, thankfully stable, fractures to heal.

A day shy of 14 weeks on, having physio'd hard and ridden as best I could for a couple of months I rolled out of Llanbrynmair very much with the intention of just getting round in sub-24 and no hopes nor expectations beyond that. The route had a couple of loops, and the first fork was to a long road climb leading to the first off road section which climbed yet further.

From this first summit, the route dropped on to forest tracks with a long and fast descent back to a road section. I sped along enjoying the morning sun when things started to look a little too familiar. I suddenly realised I was heading back to the start, and it dawned on me I'd missed a fork in the route getting on for 10km back, and a long climb back at that. Oh well. I rode back up, picking up a couple of other riders who'd made the same mistake.

Back on route, and while I was tip-toeing around a large puddle, Alex splashed straight through it. I rode with him for a short while. He was doing the '300' and had also gone off course, adding what he thought would be 2 hours to his ride time.

Post-accident I've really lost my bottle on descents. The route wasn't that technical but I was thankful it was dry. There were a few sections that had me anxious and looking to scrub any speed I was carrying.

I passed another couple of riders and felt I was making good progress. Dropping into Machynlleth I saw a bunch of riders stopped and joined them. 'The café shuts at 3 so be quick', they said which was a bit of a surprise. In my mind it was barely noon. We were barely 60km in and I'd been riding for getting on 8 hours. I grabbed a steak sandwich then made a pit stop to fill water bottles and carried on riding with the guys I'd met.

We became a bit strung out and I found myself chatting with Mike as we climbed. We caught another rider as we got close to Dolgellau, and descended together all then stopping to grab supplies at the last place we were likely to pass through during daylight or opening hours. We split up and each rode on alone.

Darkness fell as I approached Coed-y-Brenin forest. I knew some of these trails and the roads that followed which was reassuring. As the route hit its northerly most point, it turn sharply into a head wind. Not so bad at lower level, but blowing strongly on anything remotely high. This coincided with my front brake starting to rub incessently.
