What's the Welsh for 'stabby bastard hills'?

In Mid-2019 I decided to commit to another ultra-distance race to give my riding a bit of focus in terms of training for something in particular. I didn't fancy flying, as COVID-19 was still affecting people's travel plans, so looked for something close to home. I saw <a href="http://abikerace.co.uk">A Bike Race</a> mentioned on the Twitters, and it seemed to fit the bill: still 6+ months away to work on fitness and easy to get to the start by train. 

The race had an interesting sounding premise, self-supported with no set route and checkpoints dotted around the coast of Wales. Waypoints between checkpoints were to be unveiled just a couple of days before the race to give entrants the same limited time to plan an optimum route. That optimum route was a personal choice: stick to A roads for speed; take smaller lanes to avoid traffic; take off-road sections to break it up, all of course somewhat dependent on bike choice. I chose to go with my Fugio shod with 38mm GravelKing SKs that'll roll nicely on the road, but put up with a bit of rough stuff too. 

2 days before the race we received the list of waypoints. I'd expected there to be decisions to be made as to the most efficient order in which to tackle them, but they really just fell sequentially into place en route between the already-known checkpoints. For each waypoint to waypoint segment, I looked at route options using Komoot, switching between 'road' and 'gravel' options and deciding which looked best based largely on gut reaction to distance and elevation profile. 

I travelled down to Chepstow the day before the race. At Birmingham New St I spotted a guy with a bike like mine also set up for bikepacking. It transpired he (Ben) was also heading to the race start and we travelled the remainder to the journey together, having each been delayed by cancelled trains. We then ended up both staying at the same hotel so chatted over dinner about our race plans. Ben was hoping sub-3 days and to ride through the night, whereas I just wanted to come in by midnight on day 4, with the only time schedule I'd set being the points I knew I'd need to reach each day to achieve this aim. As a goal though, 3 1/2 days made for a nice rounded target to push for: 8pm on Monday. This also meant I'd be able to catch a train from the finish that evening.

As I rolled down to the start point it was raining lightly. Rain wasn't forecast but getting wet early could make for a miserable day, so I elected to start in full waterproofs. We registered and were given goodie bags, a t-shirt, and race number. Other than some cereal bars I handed everything back. A 'trees not tees' option would have been nice, but the promotional schwag/landfill issue is certainly not unique to this event. 

Having taken a group photo we rolled off in groups of 3 or so. I was first away so got to see a fair few riders come past and said hello. A group came by as a mini-peleton. I suggested that perhaps drafting wasn't on in a self-supported race, but then apologised for being a dick: Their race, their choice, and it wasn't going to affect my ride one way or the other. Anyway, such groups soon broke up into single riders and for the rest of the event there was the odd crossing of paths with similarly paced riders.

The fast kids had started to get their heads down and legs up to speed and passed in the opposite direction as I approached the first waypoint. We were required to take a photo at each waypoint to act as a brevet card, and I guess as social media content too although I think this must have been happening on the 'gram as I was the only user on Twitter using the #aBikeRace hashtag! Riders were still grouped enough to remind each other to take a snap before the field began to disperse as we headed west.
